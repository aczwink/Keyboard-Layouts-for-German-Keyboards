# Mac-OS-X-German-PC-Keyboard-Layout
The missing German PC Keyboard Layout for OS X

## Install
Simply copy "german-pc.keylayout" to "/Library/Keyboard Layouts"

## Issues
There are two known issues that can not be fixed just by the keyboard layout.
1. The "Menu" or "Application" key is not recognized as right-command.
This can be fixed with the software "Karabiner-Elements" by adding a
"simple modification" from "application" to "right_command".
2. Another issue is that some keys do not behave as expected in the macOS
environment. Again "Karabiner-Elements" can help.
I recommend the following complex modifications:
* "PC-Style Shortcuts" -> "PC-Style Home/End"
* "Finder" -> "Use Return as Open and Use Fn+Return as Rename"
